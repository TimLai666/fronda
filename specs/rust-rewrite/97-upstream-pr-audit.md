# Upstream PR Audit — Rust Rewrite Applicability

Latest re-audit: 2026-07-17
Upstream HEAD: `cfa9e05e` (palmier-io/palmier-pro main, v0.6.10)
Previous audits: 2026-07-05 at `771b63e` (v0.6.1), 2026-07-03 at `9a3ae50`,
2026-06-25 at `b9b4ad9`

This file catalogs every upstream PR (from the Swift `palmier-pro` repo), its
current porting status in Fronda, and any action items.

The **2026-07-17 Re-audit** section below covers `771b63e..cfa9e05e`
(v0.6.1 → v0.6.10). Earlier sections remain valid for older PRs.

# 2026-07-17 Re-audit (771b63e → cfa9e05e, v0.6.1 → v0.6.10)

Method: 47 PR units audited by parallel agents (each read the real diffs with
`git show` and cross-checked current Rust source with file:line evidence);
every PORT/DONE verdict then re-checked by an independent adversarial
verifier (22 checks, 1 verdict corrected). Full evidence trail in the
workflow journal (session 2026-07-17). Items already ported before this
audit (#293 audio meter, #291 chroma eyedropper, #283 multicam v2, #138 HDR,
#176 duplicate_clips, #284 aspect labels core, #263 tool-surface v2,
#274 beat detection baseline, #211 autosave, #65 wght) were not re-opened.
The Swift baseline itself was merged to v0.6.10 in-tree on 2026-07-17.

## Ported by change `upstream-v0610-compat-ports` (2026-07-17)

| PR | Item | Scope ported |
|----|------|--------------|
| #342 | add_clips auto-track semantics | all-omitted branch always creates fresh shared tracks (was reusing first existing track — data-destructive overwrite of linked dialogue via place_clips overwrite semantics); description text |
| #307 | manage_tracks addressing | stable trackId selector (XOR index), out-of-zone reorder → hard error, reordered/removedTracks receipts, get_timeline trackId, id_universe + SCALAR_ID_KEYS; Swift accepts integral floats for index, Rust keeps strict as_i64 (documented) |
| #274-followups | detect_beats contract fixes | has_audio up-front rejection; windowed bpm recomputed (audio_core estimate_bpm = 60/median IBI); empty-analysis/empty-window notes; bpm/downbeats omission; beat_cache (size,mtime) invalidation tag |
| #333 | import_media contract text | description/path text synced to in-place registration + synchronous ready (executor behavior was already post-#333; the text actively misled agents into polling) |
| #338 | CAF audio support | ClipType::from_extension + content_type_for_extension (audio/x-caf) + media_library AUDIO extensions + import_media format list + mime rejection message |
| #294 (slice) | GenerationInput.targetLanguage | media.json additive serde field (Swift-written value survived Fronda round-trip; skip_serializing_if) — rest of #294 in the decision list |
| #336 (slice) | TextStyle underline/strikethrough/overline | on-disk serde fields through TextStyleWire (data-loss class of #65); renderer/inspector deferred |
| #330 (slice) | TextStyle rich styling fields | tracking/lineSpacing/fontCase/border.width + 9-field Background on-disk round-trip; nested style agent args + render semantics deferred |

## DONE — verified already satisfied in Rust (no action)

| PR | Evidence |
|----|----------|
| #288 | Video-to-audio span validation mirrored at tool_exec.rs generate_audio (both branches, 1..600s defaults) with tests; scoring-render shrink is Swift-render-only. |
| #57 | search_core strip_unicode_extensions covers `-u-*` (TRN-014) plus `@rg=` ICU form; transcription itself remains host-deferred. |
| #268 | prompt_caching model_request_extras merges `{"output_config":{"effort":"low"}}` for sonnet-5 in both request-build paths (PORTED 2026-07-10). |
| #261 | Speech suite: speakers registry round-trips opaquely; remove_silence matches shipped contract incl. in-PR review fixes; VAD host adapter is the archived `speech-analysis-seam` boundary. |
| #329 | Undo-boundary bug class absent: Rust agent undo is snapshot-per-tool-call (settings auto-detect inside the same snapshot). |
| #331 | Rust UndoStack is already the PR's end state: single shared user/agent history, no session gating, no boundary plumbing. |
| #334 | Rust never eager-hydrates: metadata lazy via ffprobe on access; thumbnails on-demand tiered (video_thumbnails); no per-open hydration pass. |

## DEFERRED — applicable but blocked (tracked, with blockers)

| PR | Blocker |
|----|---------|
| #269 (engine half) | **min-overlap floor DONE 2026-07-17** (change `sync-min-overlap-floor`: find_sync_offset excludes lags with overlap < max(16 hops, 3 s) — the thin-edge false-match bug). Remaining deferred: centerLag/capture-date seeding, NTSC-exact frameDuration. Contract half was already DONE (tool-surface v2). |
| #296 | 65-point .cube LUT cap: no Rust .cube parser exists at all — `color.lut` is stored but never parsed/applied. Blocked on a LUT engine (compositor follow-up); carry the 128 cap when it lands. |
| #285 (behavior half) | canUseCloudTranscription(cost vs credits): transcription + account/credit state are host-deferred. Description text half already DONE (tool-surface v2). |
| #276 | models:list resubscribe backoff: no Convex client in Rust; static catalog. Carry when a live catalog subscription exists. |
| #273 | Unreadable-media readiness classification (unprocessable vs missing + failed status): needs the media-probe host seam; Rust honest-degradation via missing_entry_ids covers part today. |
| #339 | Scrub-audio PCM cache/prefetch: no live audio output engine in Rust (audio meter is playhead-driven). Carry with the audio playback engine. |
| #280 | Fade-handle UI refinements (ramp display, knee clamp, directional cursors): fade math fully ported; blocked on timeline direct-manipulation UI maturity. |
| #292 | Hosted-chat model availability: no hosted/account-proxy chat path in Rust (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY only). |

## PORT — feature tier, needs an explicit go decision (not auto-ported)

| PR | Scope | Effort |
|----|-------|--------|
| #299 | Consolidate get_projects/open_project/new_project/close_project → manage_project(action=list\|open\|create\|close) with per-action validation; changes MCP tool counts (4 assertion files) + projectNavigation instructions | M |
| #298 | Cancellable FIFO export queue (job state machine, destination reservation, staged output writes) | L |
| #294 (rest) | generate_audio full contract: sourceMediaRef/targetLanguage args, cleanup/dubbing categories + gating, silent-video reject, duration=source, list_models fields, catalog/payload extension (dormant until a generation backend exists) | M |
| #330 (rest) | Nested partial-patch `style` object for add_texts/update_text/add_captions (replaces flat fields, textCase removal) + render/FCPXML semantics (fontCase, tracking, lineSpacing, background offset/outline) | L |
| #336 (rest) | Underline/strikethrough/overline rendering bars + agent args + inspector traits | S–M |
| #281 | Timeline clip color palette (darker TrackColor set — theme.rs/ui_constants THM-007 now stale vs merged Swift), full-opacity fills, compact duration labels, keyframe marker alignment | S |
| #327 | Editor panel redesign (EditorPanelGroup collapsible groups, action footers, restructured inspector/media tabs) — NOTE: supersedes parts of the just-landed shell parity's visual reference | M |
| #319 | Settings/Help/Home refresh + Skills settings UI; includes window default sizes home/settings → 1200x800 (small standalone parity fix) | L |
| #284-leftover | Aspect-label picker polish (audit found the porting table's "picker wiring follow-up" note stale — wiring landed; remaining delta is minor UI) | S |

## SKIP — Swift-only (platform/runtime) — no Rust work

#341 (dead code removal), #337 (NSDocument safe-save race), #328 (Dictionary
trap + MainActor restore batching), #335 (SwiftUI invalidation isolation),

backend), #272 (CoreVideo color-tag passthrough), #266 (Swift file split).

## SKIP — infra/telemetry — no Rust work

## Legend

- **DONE** — Ported to Rust and verified with tests.
- **NOT STARTED** — Applicable to Rust, not yet ported.
- **N/A (Swift-specific)** — Relies on AVFoundation, Metal, AppKit, or other
  Apple-only APIs. No Rust equivalent needed.
- **N/A (Reverted)** — Was merged then reverted upstream; not applicable.
- **DEFERRED** — Applicable but blocked on larger infra or spec work first.

# 2026-07-03 Re-audit (b9b4ad9 → 9a3ae50, 86 commits)

Method: each commit's real diff was read with `git show` and compared against
current Rust source. Rust-relevance judged per subsystem (not from title alone).

Key cross-cutting judgment: **Swift `Int(Double)` traps on overflow; Rust `as`
casts saturate and `serde_json::Number::as_i64()` returns `None` out-of-range.**
So Swift crash-hardening PRs (e.g. #201) are SWIFT-ONLY for the crash itself;
only their *validation semantics* (reject vs clamp) are portable, and low value.

## Tier 0 — Already satisfied in Rust (verify-only, no port)

| PR | Item | Evidence |
|----|------|----------|
| #163 | trimEndFrame stored as tail amount, not out-point | `timeline_core/src/lib.rs:89-95` `source_frames_consumed`/`source_duration_frames` bake the invariant `consumed + trim_start + trim_end == source`. |
| #203 | Per-clip blend modes (data model) | `core_model/src/timeline.rs` `BlendMode` enum (16 modes) + `Clip.blend_mode`. Rendering application still TODO (Tier 3). |
| #151 | Timeline zoom buttons clickable | `app_shell_gpui/src/toolbar_view.rs:242-296`. Only mismatch: step factor 1.5 vs Swift 1.25 — trivial parity tweak. |
| #232 | Deterministic transcripts (filtering half) | `search_core` `Transcript::filter_range` (TRN-005/006). Full-file cache identity is a platform-layer concern. |
| #189 | Caption phrase timing from per-word timestamps | `search_core/src/caption.rs:279` `phrases_from_words` already times each phrase by its first word's `start_seconds` and last word's `end_seconds`, and builds phrase text from the words themselves — so the Swift char-distribution→per-word-timestamp change and the phrase/word alignment concern are structurally absent. Verified 2026-07-03. Minor divergence: Rust drops words with invalid (negative) timestamps rather than char-distributing them. |

## Tier 0 — Not applicable to Rust (SWIFT-ONLY)

| PR | Reason |
|----|--------|
| #201 | `Int(Double)` overflow trap. Rust saturates / returns `None`; no crash path. Validation-reject semantics optional, low value. |
| #253 | AVFoundation audio-extraction concurrency gate. No Rust audio extraction pipeline. |
| #184 | Swift main-actor offloading. Rust backend is already async; gpui shell does not hang. |
| #148 | Off-main image decode is Swift actor isolation. Minor: `id_short` micro-opt could still be applied if it is O(n²). |
| #66c1e10 | Restore manifest before window mount — Rust load order already correct; verify only. |
| #217 | "generating" (not offline) preview overlay — pure UI, unblocks after #216 data model. |

## Tier 1 — High-value pure-logic ports (testable, low risk) — DO FIRST

| PR | Port | Target | Effort | Status |
|----|------|--------|--------|--------|
| #236 | Symmetric trim `resolvePlacement` for add_clips/insert_clips | `agent_contract/tool_exec.rs` cmd_add_clips/cmd_insert_clips | M | **DONE 2026-07-03** — `resolve_placement` helper; type/source-length from manifest; symmetric trim + mutual-exclusivity; also fixed insert_clips `asset_id` (was a random UUID). 4 tests. |
| #233 | add_clips keeps project fps fixed; warn on source-fps divergence | same code path as #236 | S | **DONE 2026-07-03** — source seconds scaled by project fps; divergent source fps warns and points at set_project_settings; project fps never changed. Test covers it. |
| #224 | Open project with corrupt media.json (degrade to empty, not fatal) | `project_io/src/lib.rs` | S | **DONE 2026-07-03** — `read_optional_json_defaulting_on_decode_error`; corrupt manifest → empty, original file preserved. Test flipped. |
| #218 | Aspect-ratio distortion: refit auto-fitted clips on canvas change | `timeline_core::refit_transforms` (exists) + trigger | S-M | **Core existed + now wired**: `refit_transforms` resets auto-fit clips on resolution change and is invoked by `set_project_settings` (#177). Remaining refinement: Swift's aspect-preserving proportional scale + active-scale-keyframe scaling (Rust currently resets auto-fit to full-canvas default). |
| #207 | ripple_delete_ranges: per-call sync-lock exemption (`ignoreSyncLockedTracks`) | `timeline_core/src/workflow.rs` RippleDeleteConfig | M | **DONE 2026-07-04** — `RippleDeleteConfig.ignore_sync_lock_track_indices` (BTreeSet); `compute_ripple_delete` skips ignored tracks when collecting sync-locked followers into the clear-set; executor shift loop changed to `if !cleared.contains(&ti) { continue }` (shift only cleared tracks — post-#227 every non-ignored sync-locked track is already cleared, so ignored ones stay in place). Tool arg `ignoreSyncLockTrackIndices` (list of indices, matching the index-based `trackIndex` param, not Swift's id list). NO refuse (left-in-place can't collide). 2 executor tests (ignored → untouched; not-ignored → cut+rippled). Also fixed the schema `ranges` doc that lied `{startFrame,endFrame}` — the executor reads `{start,end}`. |
| #227 | Master audio: sync-locked follower tracks are CUT (cleared), not just shifted | `timeline_core/src/workflow.rs` compute_ripple_delete | M | **DONE 2026-07-04** — `compute_ripple_delete` adds every sync-locked follower to `cleared_track_indices`, so the executor clears the range on them + shifts. Cut+ripple always absorbs its own gap, so the old shift refuse was dead code (verified: the Swift refuse loop is provably vacuous for empty ignore-set; 200k-timeline fuzz, 0 broken). 2 tests. |
| #243 | Default agent model → Sonnet 5 | `app_contract/settings_storage.rs` AGENT_DEFAULT_MODEL, `chat_view.rs` model list | XS | **DONE 2026-07-03** — `sonnet46`→`sonnet5`; chat list `claude-sonnet-4-6`→`claude-sonnet-5`. Backend accepts both during rollout. Tests updated. |

## Tier 2 — New agent tools / schema (medium) — parity features

| PR | Tool / change | Target | Effort |
|----|---------------|--------|--------|
| #177 | `set_project_settings` tool + auto-match timeline on empty add | agent_contract | H | **DONE 2026-07-03** (tool + presets + fps rescale + refit + undo; 6 tests). The rescale/refit core (`apply_fps`/`refit_transforms`/`apply_settings`) already existed in `timeline_core/src/project_settings.rs`; only the tool layer was missing. **Auto-match-on-add (`applySettingsIfNeededForAgent`) still deferred.** |
| #186 | `split_clip` → `split_clips` batch (two modes, dedup, A/V regroup) | agent_contract | M | **DONE 2026-07-03** — renamed tool; explicit `splits` + `trackIndex`/`frames` modes; validate-all-then-apply (no partial state); dedup; re-resolves each cut against current sub-clips; reuses `timeline_core::split_clip` (already does linked A/V regroup). 3 tests. Also added `object_optional` schema helper (the shared `object()` marked every prop required — wrong for exactly-one-of tools; now used by split_clips + set_project_settings for correct MCP schemas). |
| #178 | `language` (BCP-47) param threaded into get_transcript/inspect_media | agent_contract read path | M (schemas already list it) |
| #160 #245 | `remove_words` tool (word→frame, ripple linked partners) + `matches` filler tokens | timeline_core, agent_contract | M | **PURE CORE DONE 2026-07-04** — `timeline_core::word_cut`: `WordCutPlanner` (`cut_ranges`: cut each run of selected words + up to half the adjacent gap, merge), `span_frames` (source-sec→project-frame, speed/trim/visible-window clamp), `CutAggressiveness` (tight 60 / balanced 150 / loose 320 ms), `ms_to_frames`, `TimelineWord`, `plan_word_removal` (group-by-clip → ranges-by-track → **single primary track**: refuse unlinked multi-track, else min index of one link group; only the primary track's ranges are cut, the ripple carries linked partners). 16 unit tests mirror Swift `WordCutPlannerTests` exactly. `agent_contract::cmd_remove_words` + tool schema + `parse_word_spans`/`parse_word_matches`/`normalized_word_match` (index-clamp per #245 so an out-of-range span can't iterate wildly; `matches` case/punct-insensitive tokens; words XOR matches). Ripple-apply refactored into shared `apply_ripple_delete_on_track` (reused by ripple_delete_ranges). 10 executor tests incl. e2e cut+report. **Host-deferred**: the transcriber (`timelineWords`) — Rust has no SpeechTranscriber, so `set_timeline_words` is the seam (empty → "No transcribable speech", same boundary as get_transcript/#178). #245 `matches` ported; #245's cloud-provider + language-reuse (c12999a) are host-transcription concerns. |
| #152 | `send_feedback` tool (session dedup + 8/session cap + diagnostics) | agent_contract | L |
| #245 | `TranscribedWord.speaker` field + `remove_words` `matches` filler-token arg | search_core, agent_contract | L-M (cloud provider itself is SWIFT-ONLY) |
| #249 | `paid_only` on model catalog + free-tier gating in list_models | generation_core, agent_contract | M | **BLOCKED (host/data) 2026-07-04.** Gating logic is pure (`model_available = is_paid \|\| !paid_only`, `require_plan`), but Rust `cmd_list_models` returns HARDCODED placeholder models (gen-3/kling/sd3/…) — the real catalog (VideoModelConfig.allModels etc.) is never loaded into the agent. Porting `paid_only` now would gate fake data. Do #249 only after the real model catalog is wired into the agent (list_models/generate read live `ModelConfig`s). The `paid_only` FIELD + gating helpers can be added to `generation_core` any time; the TOOL-level gating waits on catalog wiring + a host `is_paid` seam. |
| #219 | `import_status` field on manifest entry (preparing/downloading/failed) | core_model, agent_contract | M | **Mostly host + speculative 2026-07-04.** Actual Swift field is `importInput: MediaImportInput? {sourceURL, sourcePath, createdAt}` (resume source), and import LIFECYCLE reuses the already-ported `generation_status` (restore skips `.failed`). Bulk of #219 (`ToolExecutor+Import` async placeholders, background download, 128 lines) is host I/O. The portable core is just an `import_input` persistence struct — low value without the async-import host logic (marginal round-trip safety). Defer unless async import is wired host-side. |
| #242 | `create_matte` tool + MatteAspect presets | core_model, agent_contract, app_shell | M | **DONE 2026-07-05 (end-to-end).** `core_model::matte`: `MatteAspect` (7 presets Project/16:9/9:16/1:1/4:3/9:14/2.4:1) + `even`/`fit`/`pixel_size`/`parse` (pure, 6 tests, mirrors Swift `Matte.even`/`fit`). `agent_contract::cmd_create_matte` + tool schema (58→59 tools): parses hex (`TextRgba::from_hex`) + aspect + name/folder, computes even pixel dims from the aspect + timeline size, hands the colour+size to a host `MatteWriter` seam, and registers the resulting `ClipType::Image` asset (matte = an image, NO `ClipType::Matte`). `app_shell::matte_writer::ProjectMatteWriter` implements the seam: renders a solid-colour PNG (`image` crate) and writes it into the open project's `media/` dir, returning a project-relative `MediaSource`; wired on project open/save-as in `editor_state_hub`. The pure executor stays FS-free (the MCP/headless path leaves the writer unset → "unavailable"). 4 executor tests (mock writer) + 2 writer tests (valid PNG on disk) + 6 sizing tests. |

## Tier 3 — Large new subsystems — need own sub-spec each

| PR(s) | Subsystem | Target | Effort |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| #193 | **FCPXML export v1 baseline** | `render_core/src/fcpxml_export.rs` | XL | **v1 DONE 2026-07-03** — valid FCPXML 1.10: `<resources>` (format + deduped assets w/ media-rep src), `<library>/<event>/<project>/<sequence>/<spine>` with a full-length `<gap>` anchoring every clip as a connected `<asset-clip>` at absolute offset, lane per track (video +, audio −), rational project time. 6 tests. **Wired into the export UI + execution**: `ExportMode::Fcpxml` ("Final Cut Pro (.fcpxml)"), pure `interchange_content()` generator (also covers XMEML), and `write_interchange()`. The Export button now opens a save dialog (`prompt_for_new_path`) and writes the `.xml`/`.fcpxml` file from the live editor timeline+manifest — so both interchange formats actually produce files, and the panel shows a success ("Exported to …") or failure message (`set_interchange_result`). (Video render execution + `.palmier` bundle write are separate, still TODO.) |
| #214 | FCPXML format naming + Rec.709 colorspace | `render_core/src/fcpxml_export.rs` | L | **DONE 2026-07-03** — `format_rate_suffix`/`recognized_video_format_name`/`sequence_format_name`/`frame_duration_str` (NTSC-aware); sequence `<format>` now named (`FFVideoFormat1080p30`, else `FFVideoFormatRateUndefined`) with `colorSpace="1-1-1 (Rec. 709)"`. 3 helper tests + updated exporter tests. Per-asset formats still shared with the sequence (full per-asset formats come with #206). |
| #206 | FCPXML per-asset formats (partial) | `render_core/src/fcpxml_export.rs` | M | **Per-asset formats DONE 2026-07-03** — each visual asset now emits its own `<format>` from its source width/height/fps (`video_format_name`, `frame_duration_str`); audio assets carry no format; visual assets without source dims fall back to `r1`. Assets already dedup by media_ref (same-source A/V collapses to one asset w/ hasVideo+hasAudio). **DONE**: also fixed the frameDuration grid (project fps, not source fps, so asset duration + asset-clip in-point align) and per-clip `format` reference (own format for video, omitted for audio); and the synced-A/V-pair collapse — `redundant_audio_clip_ids` drops the audio partner of a 1-video/1-audio link group sharing source/timing/trim/speed AND enabled state. The `enabled` guard IS ported (derived from the TRACK: video `!hidden`, audio `!muted`) — a muted audio partner is NOT collapsed, or its silenced audio would become audible via the video asset-clip. Multiple tests. Only Swift's volume-from-partner emission is unported (the Rust exporter emits no per-clip volume). |
| #197 #247 #254 | FCPXML refinements on the v1 baseline | `render_core/src/fcpxml_export.rs` | L each | retime `<ref-clip>` compound wrapping (#197), source timecode (#247), per-target (Resolve/FCP) transform/crop/blend calibration + text stroke (#254). **#247 source timecode DONE 2026-07-04** — `start_timecode_frames(entry, fps) = round(source_timecode_frame/quanta*fps)` (0 when absent); each `<asset start>` now emits its embedded timecode (was `0s`), and each `<asset-clip>` in-point adds that origin (`origin + trim_start`), so Resolve doesn't flag a timecode mismatch. Uses the #136 manifest timecode fields. 3 tests (no-tc → `0s`; tc offsets asset+clip; quanta≠fps rescale). **#197 retiming DONE 2026-07-05** — a clip with `speed != 1` now emits a `<timeMap frameSampling="floor">` (two `<timept>`s mapping the output span to `[origin, origin+mediaFrames)` of the source) and its in-point `start` is on the retimed axis (`rational_time(trimStart*q, fps*p)`); keyframe `<param>` times also move to the retimed output axis (`keyframe_time_str` = `(trimStart*q + frame*p)/(fps*p)`). Current Swift emits `<timeMap>` on the asset-clip (not a `<ref-clip>` wrapper), which this mirrors: `rational_speed` (best p/q ≤1000), `rational_time`, `build_time_map`. 5 tests (rational helpers, timeMap span, 1× → no timeMap, retimed start `1/4s`, retimed keyframe time on output axis). **Relink-by-filename DONE 2026-07-04** — the asset + asset-clip `name` attributes now emit the on-disk filename (source path's last component, extension preserved) instead of the display label, so Resolve relinks by name (`file_name` helper; 1 test). **#247 fully ported.** **#254 scalar + static geometry DONE 2026-07-04** — the asset-clip carries, in Swift's child order: `<adjust-crop mode="trim">` (Resolve trim-rect: `top/bottom = crop*100/fit`, `left/right = crop*sw*100/seqH`), `<adjust-conform type="fit">`, `<adjust-transform>` (scale `= size/fitFraction`, sign-flipped per mirror axis; rotation `= -model rotation`; anchor `0 0`; position in FCP points `= (centre-0.5)*seqDim/(seqH/100)/fit`, y-up-negated), `<adjust-blend amount>` (opacity), `<adjust-volume amount>` (dB `20*log10`). `fit_fractions`/`scale_value`/`position_value`/`clip_adjustments`/`format_number` mirror Swift's Resolve target. Emitted only when non-default (default clip → self-closing, backward-compat verified); conform accompanies any geometry so the fit-relative scale/position stay consistent. 8 geometry/scalar tests with hand-computed values (FCPXML transform/crop math independently adversarially audited — no divergence). **Keyframed opacity + transform DONE** — `<adjust-blend>` and `<adjust-transform>` carry `<param>/<keyframeAnimation>` children (clip-relative keyframe time, `curve="linear"` for linear segments). Transform position/scale/rotation values are sampled through `timeline_core::resolved_transform_at` per keyframe, so the top-left→centre + size coupling is handled correctly (hand-computed test: top-left ramp → centre positions). Shared `write_kf_param` helper. **`enabled` DONE** — a hidden video / muted audio track's clips export `enabled="0"`. **Text `<title>` DONE** — text overlays (previously skipped entirely) now emit a `<title>` referencing a once-declared `titleBasic` effect resource, with a `<text>`/`<text-style-def>` pair (font family from the name, face from weight, size, `fontColor` r g b a, alignment), a fit-conform + position transform, and static opacity (`write_title`/`font_family_fallback`/`color_string`). **Title border stroke DONE** — `strokeColor`/`strokeWidth` (`0.04·fontSize`) when the border is enabled. The keyframe + title output was independently adversarially audited (2026-07-05): keyframe time axis is clip-relative and matches Swift's `keyframeFrames`(absolute)+`keyframeTime`(−startFrame) exactly (regression test at a non-zero start frame confirms it stays clip-relative while the clip `offset` is absolute), the position top-left→centre coupling is faithful, and the title node matches byte-for-byte incl. the effect `uid`. **Collapsed-pair linked-audio volume DONE** — when a synced A/V pair collapses into the video asset-clip, the `<adjust-volume>` uses the dropped audio partner's gain (Swift's `linkedAudio ?? clip`), not the video clip's own volume (`redundant_audio_clip_ids` now also returns a video-id→audio-volume map). **Keyframed title opacity DONE** — titles share the `append_opacity_blend` helper, so animated text opacity round-trips too. **FCP-target ENCODING DONE 2026-07-05** — `FcpxmlTarget` enum (Resolve default, mirroring Swift `FCPXMLTarget.default`) + `export_with_target`; for `Fcp` the transform `fit` is `(1,1)` (raw frame-relative scale/position, no aspect-fit compensation) and the crop trim-rect uses plain 0..100 percentages instead of the source-pixel/seq math. `export()` still defaults to Resolve, so existing behaviour is unchanged. 1 test compares Resolve vs FCP scale + crop on hand-computed values (square + 4K sources). Remaining host piece: the export-dialog dropdown to let the user PICK Final Cut Pro (trivial gpui follow-up; the encoding is complete + tested). **Auto-fit-every-visual-clip DONE 2026-07-05** — `<adjust-conform type="fit">` is now emitted for EVERY visual asset-clip (matching Swift), so a source whose resolution/aspect differs from the timeline is fit into the frame rather than shown at native size; it's a no-op for matching sources. (Closes the last geometry divergence the transform audit flagged.) **FCP-target selector DONE 2026-07-05** — `ExportViewModel.fcpxml_target` (+ setter) threads through `interchange_content`/`write_interchange`, and the export dialog shows a "Calibrate for: DaVinci Resolve / Final Cut Pro" toggle. **#254 is now FULLY ported** (geometry for both targets + user selection). Formerly-pending, now resolved. **Historical note**: the title `fontFace` now reflects both bold AND italic (`Bold`/`Italic`/`Bold Italic`/`Regular`) since the **#65 `TextStyle` on-disk-format compat bug was fixed 2026-07-05** — Swift-authored `isBold`/`isItalic` now round-trip into Rust's `TextStyle`. |

Place-new mode — each slot takes a `mediaRef` plus top-level `startFrame`/`durationFrames`; creates a stacked video track per slot by z-order (insert-at-0 ascending z → highest z on top), places a new clip per slot with the layout transform/crop baked in, and auto-detects project settings from the first video (via the #177 auto-match seam). 25 tests (7bcfafb). |

Their FULL behaviour switches the whole app's active project mid-turn (an app-navigation seam like `MatteWriter`, plus `delete_project` is DESTRUCTIVE) — this warrants confirmation before wiring (app-nav + data-loss), so it's deferred.

## Non-PR parity (Swift↔Rust gap sweep, 2026-07-03)

Beyond upstream PRs, a multi-agent sweep mapped Swift capabilities missing in
Rust. Landed pure-logic wins (all unit-tested): `format_aspect_ratio`,
`format_duration`, `db_from_linear`/`linear_from_db` (timeline_core::inspector);
`ClipType::content_type_for_extension` (core_model); `SettingsState` model
toggle (app_contract); `format_cost` em-dash fix (generation_core); moment
drag-segment `#start-end` (timeline_core::drag_payload); `EmbeddingStore`
binary `to_bytes`/`from_bytes` (search_visual).

Still-open pure-logic items: pack the 144-line Swift AgentInstructions into
`SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION`; SHA256 transcript cache identity (needs `sha2`).
The XMEML `xml_export` items from the earlier note are now DONE (verified
2026-07-04): keyframed motion+opacity (XML-012), `file://` path norm, `<file>`
dedup (manifest threaded via `export_with_manifest`), and **fade→transitionitem**
— fades now export as single-sided Cross Dissolve (video) / Cross Fade (audio)
`<transitionitem>`s, the form Premiere actually reads, instead of the ignored
`<fadein>/<fadeout>` tags (`write_fade_transition`, 3 tests; mirrors Swift
`XMLExporter.fadeTransition` incl. `cutPointTicks`, alignment, effect IDs).
The sweep also confirmed many suspected gaps are already DONE (keyframe
smoothstep interpolation, folder-drag, `resolved_transform_at`/`crop_at`,
model-config validate/discount).

## Incomplete tool ports (advertised-but-stubbed, found 2026-07-05)

A definitive coverage test (`every_advertised_tool_is_dispatched`, agent_contract)
found **12 of the 59 advertised tools had schemas but no executor dispatch** —
they returned the misleading "Unknown tool". Schemas landed ahead of the logic
across Issues #154/#155/#157/#158/#165/#172/#174. Each returns an honest
limitation message (or is now implemented); the test permanently guards the class.
**6 of the 12 are now implemented (2026-07-05):**

- **#155 compound clips** — end-to-end: `timeline_core::compound`
  (create/dissolve/`flatten_compound_clips`, single-track), agent executor commands
  (via `exec_mut` so undo captures them), and flatten at every render/export
  chokepoint (`compose_frame`, `mix_timeline_audio`, XMEML + FCPXML export) so a
  compound clip renders/exports its nested content. Decode closures key on the
  manifest, so flattened constituents decode with no export-path change. v1 is
  single-track; composing a transform/fades on the compound clip *itself* onto the
  group, and a persistent display name (needs a Clip/Timeline name field —
  `MediaSource` is file-only), are follow-ups.
- **#157 clip presets** — `save/apply/list_clip_presets` via an in-memory store on
  the executor (capture transform/crop/opacity/volume/speed/effects/blend/chroma;
  apply routes speed through `apply_clip_speed`). #157 is Rust-native (no Swift
  equivalent), so this already surpasses Swift. Persisting presets to project.json
  (a data-model decision) is a follow-up.
- **#174 remove_silence** — the pure detector already existed
  (`audio_core::silence_detector`); added `rms_envelope`, a `ClipAudioSource` host
  seam, `cmd_remove_silence` (envelope → detect → source→frame map → ripple
  delete), and the ffmpeg-backed app decoder (`ProjectAudioSource`). Honest
  "unavailable" on the MCP/headless path.

Stubbed tools: NONE remain (2026-07-05). `open_project` is now real and
`new_project` joined it (ProjectNavigator seam); the speculative
`create_project`/`delete_project`/`import_xml` names were removed after the
full upstream ToolDefinitions comparison showed they never shipped.

## Tool-surface drift vs upstream v0.6.1 (full name-list diff, 2026-07-05)

Upstream tools we DON'T have (each needs its own port decision):
`update_text`, `export_project` (agent-driven export incl. the #255 timelineId
arg), `send_feedback`, `get_projects` + `new_project` (upstream's real
project-nav pair — our `create_project`/`delete_project`/`duplicate_project`
stub names don't exist upstream; realign when tackling #238; upstream has no
delete tool at all). Also fixed in this pass: our #119 tool shipped as
`sync_audio_clips` but upstream's name is `sync_audio` — renamed + schema
aligned (targetClipId single form, searchWindowSeconds → windowed correlation).
Rust-native extensions kept deliberately (not drift; VERIFIED 2026-07-05 —
none exist in current upstream ToolDefinitions, `git log -S add_shapes` shows
no history either, so these agent-tool NAMES were always Rust-side; the
underlying data-model fields are real ported PR contracts): compound-clip
pair, clip presets, `add_shapes`, `apply_animation`, `set_blend_mode`,
`import_folder`, `duplicate_project`. Upstream exposes three of the
capabilities through consolidated tools instead — chroma keying via
`apply_effect` (its description lists "key"), color grading via the rich
`apply_color` (wheels/curves/hue-curves/LUT; our `set_color_grade` overlaps),
music via `generate_audio` (text-to-music models). Converging on upstream's
consolidated shapes would break our own MCP surface — a user decision, not
drift cleanup. `update_text` PORTED 2026-07-05 (merge semantics, clipIds +
captionGroupId addressing, 'off' clears animation; auto-fit box on typography
changes deferred - needs render-layer text measurement, same as add_texts).
`export_project` PORTED 2026-07-05 via the ExportHost seam (validated enums,
timelineId incl. palmier refusal, Downloads default path, overwrite handling;
video renders on a background thread returning status=started; xml/fcpxml/
palmier inline). `get_projects`, `open_project`, and `new_project` ALL PORTED 2026-07-05
(ProjectLister + ProjectNavigator seams; the navigator swaps the executor's
whole state from inside its lock, avoiding the hub-lock deadlock; speculative
create_project/delete_project stubs removed). Upstream scopes these three to
its MCP surface only (in-app agent gets read_skill instead) - Fronda keeps one
shared surface. The ONLY un-ported upstream tool is now `send_feedback` -
VERIFIED host-gated: upstream posts via the Convex SDK action feedback:send
with account-session auth, so it needs a backend seam (or a Convex Rust
client), not a plain HTTP port.

**Resolved 2026-07-05 by the v0.6.1 re-audit:** the speculative
`set_clip_audio_effects`/`set_clip_noise_reduction` stubs were REMOVED — upstream
never shipped those names; the real feature landed as **#251 `denoise_audio`**
(ported: denoise is an `audio.denoise` effect in the existing `effects` stack,
no model change; the DeepFilterNet3 bake is host-deferred).

## Upstream re-audit 2026-07-05b (771b63e → cdd63ff)

One new commit: **#261 speech detection, dead-air removal, speaker
identification** (1292 lines). Audited + contract pieces ported same day:
- **ProjectFile.speakers** (per-project speaker registry: id/name/color/
  centroid) PORTED as an opaque `serde_json::Value` passthrough threaded
  through MultiTimelineState and the authoritative narrow save — Fronda
  doesn't run speaker identification, but dropping the field on save would
  erase Swift-computed registries.
- **remove_silence contract realigned**: upstream's tool SHIPPED here with a
  different contract than the speculative Issue #174 schema we had (no
  arguments, whole-timeline, speech-detection-driven, sectionsRemoved/
  removedFrames/note payload, error on no-dead-air). Rust now defaults to
  that semantics with an ADAPTIVE RMS threshold (90th-percentile envelope
  −25 dB, floor −60 dBFS) approximating the VAD gate — honestly described;
  clipId/thresholdDb/min/pad remain a Rust clip-scoped extension.
- Host-ML-gated (not ported): Silero VAD (SpeechVAD MLX package), speaker
  embeddings/centroids, SpeechTab + waveform speech masks, per-file speaker
  alignment in get_transcript (needs the VAD/embedding models). A future
  `SpeechAnalysis` host seam (like ClipAudioSource) could feed real speech
  spans into the same dead-air path.

## Upstream re-audit 2026-07-05 (9a3ae50 → 771b63e, v0.6.1)

6 new commits. Substantive: **#251 Audio Enhancer/Denoise** (PORTED — see above)
and **#255 multiple timelines per project** (3978-line diff, PORTED IN LARGE
PART 2026-07-05; three parallel auditors extracted the exact contracts first).
Ported: the `ProjectFile` project.json root (legacy fallback mirroring Swift,
`Timeline.id/name/folderId`, `Track.displayHeight` clamped 32..200, viewStates
round-trip, sibling-preserving saves incl. the narrow autosave path);
**nesting realigned** from the speculative #155 `compound_timelines` map to
Swift's shipped representation (sequence carriers referencing sibling
timelines — recursive compositor render with group-as-unit carrier transform,
`flatten_nests` for audio/export, executor sibling store, full app wiring);
`create_timeline`/`set_active_timeline`/`duplicate_timeline` tools (59→62) +
`get_timeline` timelines list + prompt paragraph; `add_clips` timelineId
nesting (linked A/V carriers, empty + cycle rejection); `insert_clips`
timelineId nesting (ripple splice, linked audio carrier keeps sequence
source); `rename_media`/`delete_media` accept timelineIds (last-timeline
guard, deleting the active switches to a sibling). Pending: export timelineId
arg (no Rust export_project tool yet), native nested-sequence XML/FCPXML
emission (v1 flattens, content-correct), timeline tab UI. Remainder of the range: version bumps + README fix (skipped). Upstream
branches `feat/audio-suite` and `multicam` exist but are not on main — not
audited.

## Recommended execution order

1. **Tier 1 batch** (correctness, testable): #236+#233 (add_clips), #224, #218, #207+#227, #189, #243.
2. **Tier 2 agent tools**: #177 → #186 → #178 → #160 → #152 → #249/#219/#242/#245.
3. **Tier 3 by sub-spec**: FCPXML export (largest interchange gap) → apply_layout → text animation → MCP stateful sessions → generation recovery → MCP project nav.
4. **Tier 4 UI**: window sizing (#204) + zoom factor first (quick parity), then Skills (#199), inspector settings (#168), update badge (#196), preview double-click (#191), chat focus (#159).

Each Tier 3 subsystem gets its own spec file before implementation.

| #65 | Font weight in TextStyle | **DONE (on-disk compat fixed 2026-07-05)** | core_model (TextStyle) | The `TextStyle` on-disk format is now compatible with current Swift (9a3ae50). Implemented a `#[serde(from = "TextStyleWire", into = "TextStyleWire")]` bridge: on LOAD it accepts EITHER `fontWeight` (Rust) OR Swift's `isBold` (→700/400, `fontWeight` wins when both present) and reads `isItalic` into a new `TextStyle.is_italic: bool` field; on SAVE it writes BOTH `fontWeight` AND `isBold`/`isItalic`, so a `.palmier` written by either app round-trips bold + italic (additive — no key removed, so existing Rust readers are unaffected). Fixes the bidirectional data loss (Swift-authored bold/italic no longer decodes as regular in Rust; Rust weight no longer dropped by Swift). The FCPXML title `fontFace` now uses both bold and italic (`Bold`/`Italic`/`Bold Italic`/`Regular`, mirroring Swift `fontFaceFallback`). `is_italic` ripples to the (few, mostly `..Default::default()`) `TextStyle` literals. 3 new compat tests (Swift `isBold`/`isItalic` load, both-key precedence, dual-write round-trip) plus the pre-existing #65 fontWeight test and the full-project serde round-trip (proves no field dropped). Surfaced 2026-07-05 by the adversarial FCPXML title audit. Remaining nicety: fontName→trait inference for the rare no-`isBold`-no-`fontWeight` file (defaults to 400 as before); the Rust text renderer still doesn't slant italic glyphs (data is preserved for export). |

## Recommended next actions (priority order)

1. **Port `snap_to_boundary` / `snap_to_canvas_edges` on Transform** — easy win,
   Swift TransformCropTests already mapped; low risk, high parity value.
2. **Port `TimelineGeometryTests`** — timeline coordinate math.
3. **Port `ClipKeyframeExtensionTests`** — clip-level keyframe helpers.
4. ~~Write spec for PR #119 (audio sync)~~ — **DONE 2026-07-05** (`12-audio-sync.md`). Implementation is unblocked pending the offset-application decision (move clip vs `sync_offset_frames` field).
5. **Port `CaptionBuilderTests` / `CaptionGenerationTests`** — full caption
   pipeline from transcript → captions.
6. **Port `CompositionBuilderTests`** — verify CompositionPlan matches Swift.
7. **Port `PalmierProjectExportTests`** — self-contained .palmier export.
8. **Search/indexing pipeline** — requires significant new type + algorithm work.

## 2026-07-10 FULL PR+ISSUE sweep (first ever; upstream HEAD 141c69b)

Inventory: 207 PRs (146 merged/24 open/37 closed-unmerged), 79 issues
(47 open/32 closed). 19 merged PRs past cdd63ff. Full agent report in the
session; actionable extract:

**Done immediately (this session):** #283 multicamGroups +
Clip.multicamGroupId opaque passthrough (292364d — was silently erased on
Fronda saves, same class as #261 speakers).

**(b) merged-unported, ranked:** #283 multicam ENGINE (MulticamEngine,
manage_multicam/change_cam/get_multicam tools, XL — after tool-surface
decision) — **PORTED 2026-07-10**, change `multicam-engine`: typed
MulticamSource in ProjectFile, `timeline_core::multicam` (engine + creation
+ guards; MulticamEngineTests transplanted), the three reserved tools
(53 → 56 = 48 upstream + 8 extensions), move/timing/sync/track/ripple
guards wired; audio-correlation sync maps deferred (pinned offsets /
shared timecode / master-zero only — correlator seam is a follow-up);
#263 tool-surface v2 (48 consolidated tools: organize_media,
manage_tracks, close_project, mutation envelopes, relationship-first
get_timeline — XL, **USER DECIDED 2026-07-10: FOLLOW upstream v2**;
Rust-native extensions kept on top of the 48; spectra change
tool-surface-v2 tracks it) + its embedded ripple bug (**PORTED
2026-07-10**, change `upstream-critical-fixes`: compute_ripple_delete
partner propagation is now a fixpoint across ALL cleared tracks — the
lock-off-partner desync repro'd RED then fixed; tool-surface v2 itself
still pending the user decision); #269 sync_clips v2 (timecode
mode + SourceTimecode NTSC frame-duration fix ~18f/10min — verify Rust
math, M-L); #274 detect_beats + snap-to-beat (L, ML host seam); #138
10-bit HDR export via ffmpeg Main10 (**PORTED 2026-07-10**, change
`upstream-m-batch`: `video_export::VideoCodec::H265Hdr` — libx265 Main10,
YUV420P10LE, BT.2020 + ARIB-STD-B67 HLG tags, explicit error on missing
encoder, NO silent SDR fallback; `export_model.hdr` + toggle; threads via the
existing VideoCodec param, audio_export untouched); #268 sonnet5 effort:low in
requests (**PORTED 2026-07-10**: model_request_extras in build_agent_request
AND the live run_agent_turn body, shape from AgentClientTypes.swift:20);
#284 (**PORTED 2026-07-10**, change `upstream-m-batch`:
`generation_core::aspect_ratio_display_label` verbatim from
`ImageModelConfig.aspectRatioDisplayLabel`, wired into list_models
`aspectRatioLabels`)/#279 XS; #280/#281 timeline UI polish (Tier 4).

**(c) open PRs, ranked:** #124 stranded linked audio on overwrite
(**PORTED 2026-07-10**: place_clips clears linked-partner track ranges on
video-track overwrites, mirroring PR `4b776e1`'s Swift semantics; executor
repro pinned — no stranded fragment, no spurious audio track); #265
frame-arg 1e9 bound (**PORTED 2026-07-10**: overflow VERIFIED — real debug
panics in insert/move/apply_layout/add_texts paths; shared MAX_TOOL_FRAME +
require_frame_in_bounds in mutation.rs wired into validators AND executor
inline checks);
#139 drop-frame timecode divisor bug (**VERIFIED-OK 2026-07-10**: Rust
format_timecode already uses 1798/17982 divisors; frame 1800 @29.97DF =
00;01;00;02 and the 10-minute boundary are pinned by tests); #36 custom
Anthropic base URL (**PORTED 2026-07-10**: AnthropicConfig::from_env reads
ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL, chat_view wired, URL construction unit-tested);
#176 duplicate_clips (**PORTED 2026-07-10** upstream-m-batch:
full-fidelity clone with fresh ids, linked-partner auto-duplication + fresh
link group, destination overwrite, C-4 envelope, short-id, validator; tool
count 56→57 across 4 assertion files + host split); #169 viewer guides
(**PORTED 2026-07-10 upstream-m-batch**: Guides dropdown menu + toggle wiring
over the pre-existing #167 overlay/state); #198 TwelveLabs (L); #32 OpenRouter
(L); #65 wght axis renderer (**PORTED 2026-07-10 upstream-m-batch**: ab_glyph
`set_variation(wght)` + bundled variable families wired into `font_for`);
#67 duplicate-project context-menu UI (**PORTED 2026-07-10 upstream-m-batch**:
card "Duplicate" → host `plan_duplicate` + recursive copy + recents refresh);
#246 people mask (watch).

**(d) open issues = gaps, ranked:** #211 autosave (**PORTED 2026-07-10**,
change `upstream-m-batch`: `editor_state_hub` `autosave_should_fire` /
`autosave_if_dirty` / `save_now` — coalesced revision-gated save, rootless
skips, mirrors Swift `scheduleProjectCheckpointAutosave`; app_root timer/Home
wiring is a 1-line follow-up in another slice); #264 overflow hardening (**PORTED 2026-07-10**
via the #265 ceiling above); #154 XML/FCPXML
IMPORT (strategic XL, neither side has it); #164 shortcut parity (M)
(**PORTED 2026-07-10 upstream-m-batch**: `[`/`]` trim + ⇧⌫ ripple added;
V/C/A/⇧A/Esc deferred — no tool-mode/deselect concept yet);
#212 speed <0.25x (**VERIFIED-OK 2026-07-10**: Rust accepts any positive
speed end-to-end, 0.1x duration math pinned; also fixed the live executor
silently storing speed<=0 — now rejects like Swift); #140/#17/#142 multi-provider
LLM (S then L); #156 folder hierarchy → #263's path model (L); #158 audio
EQ/compression (L); #45 arrow/line shapes (S-M) (**PORTED 2026-07-10
upstream-m-batch**: `rasterize_line_or_arrow` — endpoints normalized 0..1
of the box, documented assumption since shapes are Rust-native/no Swift
rasterizer); #137 multi-window (L);
#166 export workspace panel (M); #286 dockable panels (L); #287 custom
STT (aligns with transcription seam).

Absorbed/N-A verified: #188 LAN+bearer (Rust surpasses), #190 outline,
#175, #187/#108/#96/#95 (architecture avoided), platform asks (#20/#195/
#220/#262) answered by Fronda's cross-platform reality.

## 2026-07-10b increment audit: 141c69b..404e14f (v0.6.4)

5 commits, 2 with code. #290 (PostHog telemetry) = Swift/infra-only (its
ToolExecutor+Export diff is a pure refactor, no schema/semantics change —
verified, does not perturb the v2 surface). 3 release-infra commits. The
one Rust port — #288 generate_audio video-to-audio span validation — is
DONE this session: span from videoSourceMediaRef (manifest duration) or
videoSourceStart/EndFrame ((end-start)/fps), validated against AudioCaps
min/max_seconds with #288 defaults 1..600s before the backend-gap error;
AudioCaps gained the span fields (catalog carries None); the Music tab's
fallback cap and its tests moved 900→600. Deferred XS: the
reference-render shrink (360→240 low-quality) — host render seam, only
relevant once video-to-audio rendering is wired. Upstream now fully
audited to 404e14f.
